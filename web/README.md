# redlamp.app

The project's website: Next.js (App Router), React and Tailwind CSS, with no other runtime dependencies.

```bash
mise run site            # dev server on http://localhost:3000
mise run site -- build   # production build
```

## Where the content comes from

- **Roadmap and "Everything that works today"** are read from the repository's `README.md` at build time (`lib/readme.ts`), so the site follows the README.
- **Screenshots, film icons, sample sheets and logos** are copied from `docs/` into `public/synced` by `scripts/sync-assets.mjs`, which runs before every `dev` and `build`. Regenerate them with `mise run screenshots` and `redlamp recipe film --all --install --readme`.
- **The download button** links to the latest GitHub release's zip, and the status pill at the top shows that release's version (`lib/github.ts`, refreshed hourly). The button stays hidden until the first release.
- **Features, film descriptions and principles** are curated in `content/`.
- **The explainer video** appears once `public/video/redlamp-explainer.mp4` and its poster exist; render them from `video/`.

## Deploying on Vercel

- Framework preset: Next.js.
- Root directory: `web`.
- Enable **Include files outside the root directory in the Build Step**, so the build can read `README.md` and `docs/`.
- Domain: `redlamp.app`.
